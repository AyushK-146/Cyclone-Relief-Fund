In the recent times cyclones have greatly affected the livilihoods of those living near the coasts. People become homeless, lose farmlands and there is panic and havoc. Donations can really help them to rehabilitate

My aim is to develop a simple and user friendly website through which people can donate for this cause  and bring happiness to the needy.
